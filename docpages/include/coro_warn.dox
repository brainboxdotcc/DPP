\warning D++ Coroutines are a very new feature and are currently only supported by D++ on g++ 11, clang/LLVM 14, and MSVC 19.37 or above. Additionally, D++ must be built with the CMake option DPP_CORO, and your program must both define the macro DPP_CORO and use C++20 or above. The feature is experimental and may have bugs or even crashes, please report any to [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/issues) or to our [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/dpp).
