\page install-from-source Building D++ From Source

The way you build D++ varies from system to system. Please follow the guide below for your OS:

* \subpage buildlinux "Building on Linux"
* \subpage buildwindows "Building on Windows"
* \subpage buildosx "Building on OSX"
* \subpage buildfreebsd "Building on FreeBSD"

@warning Note that you most likely don't need to build D++ from source if you're on Linux or Windows. We offer prebuilt binaries for these platforms and are listed in package managers! Check the downloads in the releases section on github.
