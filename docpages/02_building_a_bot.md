# Building with CMake

## 1. Toolchain
Before compiling, you will need to install `cmake` on your system.
To be sure that `cmake` is installed, you can type the following command:

    $ cmake --version
    cmake version 3.20.4


## 2. Create a CMake project

In an empty directory, create the following files and directories:

    - your_project/
        |-- libs/
        |-- src/
            |-- main.cpp
        |-- CMakeLists.txt


In the `libs/` directory, clone D++ with: `git clone https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP.git`

## 3. Configure CMake

Here is an example CMake configuration, adapt it according to your needs:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cmake}
# minimum CMake version required
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
# Project name, version and description
project(discord-bot VERSION 1.0 DESCRIPTION "A discord bot")

# Add DPP as dependency
add_subdirectory(libs/DPP)
add_subdirectory(libs/spdlog) # if you need a logger. Don't forget to clone sources
                              # in the `libs/` directory

# Create an executable
add_executable(${PROJECT_NAME}
    src/main.cpp
    # your others files...
)

# Linking libraries
target_link_libraries(${PROJECT_NAME}
    dpp
    spdlog # Like before, if you need spdlog
)

# Specify includes
target_include_directories(${PROJECT_NAME} PRIVATE
    libs/DPP/include
    libs/spdlog/include # Like before, if you need spdlog
)

# Set C++ version
set_target_properties(${PROJECT_NAME} PROPERTIES
    CXX_STANDARD 17 # or 20 if you want something more recent
    CXX_STANDARD_REQUIRED ON
)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Your project directory should look like this:

    - your_project/
        |-- libs/
            |-- DPP
            |-- spdlog # again, only if you need it
        |-- src/
            |-- main.cpp
        |-- CMakeLists.txt

\page build-a-discord-bot-windows-visual-studio Building a discord bot in Windows using Visual Studio

To create a basic bot using **Visual Studio 2019** or **Visual Studio 2022**, follow the steps below to create a *working skeleton project you can build upon*.

\note This tutorial assumes you are using a pre-built copy of the library from a release, or from one of the artifacts on our github page. This is much easier than building it yourself and in most cases you do not need to build your own copy of the library. You can also skip this entire tutorial, and obtain a [pre-made visual studio template containing the latest D++ build (for 32 and 64 bit, release and debug profiles) by clicking here](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/windows-bot-template/).

1. Make sure you have Visual Studio 2019 or 2022. Community, Professional or Enterprise work fine. These instructions are not for Visual Studio Code. You can [download the correct version here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/). Note that older versions of Visual Studio will not work as they do not support enough of the C++17 standard.
2. Start visual studio and choose to create a new project
   \image html vsproj_1.png
3. Choose the project type "Console Project" and click next
   \image html vsproj_2.png
4. Name your bot project. In this example i just chose the name 'MyBot'. You can have any name you like here.
   \image html vsproj_3.png
5. Open the zip file you downloaded which contains the D++ dlls, include files and lib file. Drag and drop this to your local machine and make note of where you placed it. This location will be important in later steps.
   \image html vsproj_4.png
6. Back inside visual studio, right click on the project (not solution!) in the tree in your visual studio window. choose 'Properties'.
   \image html vsproj_5.png
7. The next step is to populate the include directories and library directories sections with the paths to the D++ library and include files. The next steps will guide you through how to do this.
   \image html vsproj_6.png
8. Click 'edit' when prompted to edit the include paths section. Add the path to the include folder you extracted to your machine, which we took note of earlier. Note that it is important to add the dpp-10.0 folder, not any other folder, to this list:
   \image html vsproj_7.png
9.  Going back to the previous window, now edit the library paths. Again click 'edit' when prompted to edit the library paths section. Add the path to the library folder you extracted to your machine, which we took note of earlier. Note that once more it is important to add the dpp-9.0 folder within it, not any other folder, to this list. Also be aware this is a **different folder** than the one you just added for includes!
    \image html vsproj_8.png
10. Double check at this point that all the directories are filled in correctly. They should look generally like the ones in the screenshot below:
    \image html vsproj_9.png
11. Go to the general section in the same window now, and look for the drop down list laballed "C++ Language Standard". Make sure the selected option is **C++17 Standard (/std:c++17)**
    \image html vsproj_10.png
12. Again within the same window, go to the input section, under the linker category, and add '**dpp.lib;**' to the start of the libraries to include, as shown below:
    \image html vsproj_11.png
13. Now you can paste some code into the editor, completely replacing the 'hello world' application that visual studio made for you. The example code here is the basic bot from the first example on this site. You should at this point also double check that the architecture you have selected (in this case x86) matches the version of the dll/lib files you downloaded from the website. This is **important** as if you mismatch them the compilation will just fail.
    \image html vsproj_12.png
14. Go to the build menu and choose Build Solution (A handy shortcut for this is to just press **F7**):
    \image html vsproj_13.png
15. Observe the build output. There may be warnings, but so long as the build output ends with "1 succeeded" then the process has worked. You may now run your bot!
    \image html vsproj_14.png

## Troubleshooting

- If you get an error that a dll is missing (e.g. `dpp.dll` or `opus.dll`) when starting your bot, then simply copy all dlls from the **bin** directory of where you extracted the DPP zip file to, into the same directory where your bot's executable is. You only need to do this once. There should be several of these dll files: `dpp.dll`, `zlib.dll`, `openssl.dll` and `libcrypto.dll` (or similarly named SSL related files), `libsodium.dll` and `opus.dll`.
- Please note that if you change the architecture (step 13) you must reconfigure all of steps 7 through 12 again as these configurations are specific to each architecture. This is to allow for different sets of precompiled libs, e.g. for `x86`, `x64`, etc.
- You should run your bot from a command prompt. If you do not, and it exits, you will not be able to see any output as the window will immediately close.
- Stuck? You can find us on the [official discord server](https://discord.gg/dpp) - ask away! We don't bite!

\page build-a-discord-bot-windows-wsl Building a discord bot in Windows using WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)

This Tutorial teaches you how to create a lightweight environment for D++-development using **WSL** and **Visual Studio Code**
\note This Tutorial will use **WSL's default Ubuntu**! You might use other Distros if you prefer, but keep in mind the setup process might be different!

1. Make sure you have installed your WSL 2 environment properly using [this guide to setup up WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) and [this guide to connect to Visual Studio Code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode).
2. Now open PowerShell as an Admin and type `wsl` to start up your subsystem.
\note If you want to set up a CMake project (recommended for production bots) now, consider continuing your path of becoming the master of all Discord bots [here](https://dpp.dev/buildcmake.html), otherwise keep following this guide!
3. Go to your home directory using `cd ~`
4. Download the latest build for your Distro using `wget [url here]`. In this guide we will use the v10.0.0 build for Ubuntu x86-64: `wget https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/releases/download/v10.0.0/libdpp-10.0.0-linux-x64.deb`
\note replace the highlighted filenames with the package you downloaded earlier if you are using a different OS
5. Finally install all required deps and the library using `sudo apt-get install libopus0 && sudo apt-get install -y libopus-dev && sudo apt-get install -y libsodium-dev && sudo dpkg -i ` **libdpp-10.0.0-linux-x64.deb** ` && rm ` **libdpp-10.0.0-linux-x64.deb**
### Congratulations, you've successfully installed all dependencies! Now comes the real fun: Setting up the environment! For this tutorial we'll use a as small as possible setup, so you might create a more advanced one for production bots.
6. Navigate to a folder of your choice using `cd your/path/here` or create a new directory using `mkdir MyBot && cd MyBot`
7. Now that you've a folder to work in type `> mybot.cxx` to create a file you can work in!
8. Now you can open this file in Visual Studio Code by pressing `CTRL+SHIFT+P` and typing `Remote-WSL: New WSL Window`. This will bring up a new window. In the new window, choose `open folder` and choose the folder you've created prior. Press OK and now you have your Folder opened as a Workspace!
9. Add code to your CXX file and compile it by running `g++ -std=c++17 *.cxx -o bot -ldpp` in the same folder as your cxx file.
10. start your bot by typing `./bot`!

\page creating-a-bot-application Creating a Bot Account

Before you start coding, you need to create and register your bot in the Discord developer portal. You can then add this bot to your Discord-server.

## Creating a new bot

To create a new application, take the steps as follows:

1. Sign in to the [Discord developer portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on "New Application" on the top right.
2. Next, enter a name for the application in the pop-up and press the "Create" button.

\image html create_application_confirm_popup.png

In this example we named it "D++ Test Bot".

3. Move on by click the "Bot" tab in the left-hand side of the screen. Now click the "Add Bot" button on the right and confirm that you want to add the bot to your application.

\image html create_application_add_bot.png

On the resulting screen, you’ll note a page with information regarding your new bot. You can edit your bot name, description, and avatar here if you want to.

\image html create_application_bot_overview.png

In this panel, you can get your bot token. A bot token looks like this: `OTAyOTMxODU1NTU1MzE3ODUw.YXlm0g.9oYCt-XHXVH_z9qAytzmVRzKWTg`

\warning **Do not share this token** with anybody! If you ever somehow compromise your current bot token or see your bot in danger, you can regenerate the token in the panel.

## Adding the bot to your server

Once you've created your bot in the discord developer portal, you may wonder:
> Where is my bot now, I can't see him on my server?!

That's because you've created a bot application, but it's not on any server right now.

So to invite the bot to your server, you must create an invitation URL.

1. go again into the [Applications page](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click on your bot.
2. Go to the "OAuth2" tab and click on the subpage "URL Generator".

\image html create_application_navigate_to_url_generator.png

3. Select the "bot" scope. If your bot uses slash commands, also select "applications.commands".

You can read more about scopes and which you need for your application [here](https://discord.com/developers/docs/topics/oauth2#shared-resources-oauth2-scopes).

4. Choose the permissions required for your bot to function in the "Bot Permissions" section.

\note For bots with elevated permissions, Discord enforces two-factor authentication on the bot owner's account when added to servers that have server-wide 2FA enabled.

5. Copy and paste the resulting URL in your browser. Choose a server to invite the bot to, and click "Authorize".

\page building-a-cpp-discord-bot-in-repl Creating a Discord bot in Repl.it

@note There is a premade repl, ready for use which was built using the steps above. If you wish to use this repl simply [visit this github repository](https://github.com/alanlichen/dpp-on-repl) and click the "Run on Replit" button. Then, follow the steps in the README file.

To build a D++ bot in a repl.it instance, follow these steps. These steps are slightly more convoluted than installing D++ into a standard container as we don't have access to root in the conventional way or write access to any files outside of our home directory in a repl. This guide sidesteps the issue by locally extracting a libdpp deb file installer, and referencing the local dependencies from the command-line.

1. Use wget, or the upload button, to get the precompiled x64 release into your repl as a file, e.g. `https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/releases/download/v10.0.0/libdpp-10.0.0-linux-x64.deb`
2. Extract this deb file using `dpkg`:
```
dpkg -x *.deb .
```
3. Compile your bot, note that you should be sure to include the `pthread` library explicitly and reference the extracted dpp installation you just put into the repl:
```
g++ -o bot main.cpp -ldpp -lpthread -L./usr/lib -I./usr/include -std=c++17
```
4. Run your bot! Note that you will need to set `LD_PRELOAD` to reference `libdpp.so` as it will be located in `$HOME` and not `/usr/lib`:
```
LD_PRELOAD=./usr/lib/libdpp.so ./bot
```

Now that your bot is running, you have to keep it online. Replit automatically puts repls to sleep after some time, so you will need to ping a webserver. Unfortunately, Replit is sometimes limiting, and this is one of the only free workarounds to this issue.

1. Start a http server. This can be through any webserver, but as a simple solution, use python's built in http.server:
```
python3 -m http.server
```
2. Create an index.html file with anything inside it for the server to serve.
3. Go to [uptimerobot.com](https://uptimerobot.com/) and create an account if you dont have one.
4. After verifying your account, click "Add New Monitor".
+ For Monitor Type, select "HTTP(s)"
+ In Friendly Name, put the name of your bot
+ For your url, copy the url of the new website that repl is serving for you
+ Select any alert contacts you want, then click "Create Monitor"
Here is an example of a possible uptimerobot configuration:

\image html uptimerobot.png

## Troubleshooting

If the bot fails to start and instead you receive an error message about being banned from the Discord API, there is little to be done about this. These bans are temporary but because repl.it is a shared platform, you share an IP address with many thousands of bots, some abusive and some badly written. This will happen often and is outside of the control of yourself and us. However, you can try to migitate this by typing `kill 1` in the shell. This is not guaranteed to work, and you might need to try it a few times. If it still does not work, then we recommend instead you obtain some affordable non-free hosting instead.

If your bot continues to fall asleep even though you have a server, we advise you to double check that no errors are happening, and if the server is being pinged. If that still does not work, we again recommend you to obtain some affordable non-free hosting.
