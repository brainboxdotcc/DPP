\page default_select_value Setting Default Values on Select Menus.

This tutorial will cover how to set the default value for a select menu (that isn't a text select menu)!

\note **This only works for the following types of select menus: user, role, mentionable, and channel.** The default type of a select menu (as shown in \ref components3 "this page") does not work for this, as that supports a "placeholder".

\include{cpp} default_select_value.cpp

If all went well, you should have something like this!
