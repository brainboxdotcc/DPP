\page coding-standards Coding Style Standards

This page lists the coding style we stick to when maintaining the D++ library. If you are submitting a pull request or other code contribution to the library, you should stick to the styles listed below. If something is not covered here, ask on the [official discord server](https://discord.gg/dpp)!

## Class names, function names and method names
All class, variable/member, function and method names should use `snake_case`, similar to the style of the C++ standard library.

## Enums
Enums and their values should be `snake_case` as with class, function and method names. You do not need to use `enum class`, so make sure that enum values are prefixed with a prefix to make them unique and grouped within the IDE, e.g. `ll_debug`, `ll_trace` etc.


## Curly Braces, Brackets etc

Open curly braces on the same line as the keyword, for example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
if (a == b) {
	c();
}
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use a space after the comma in parameter lists, and after opening brackets and before closing brackets except when calling a function, e.g.:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
std::vector<std::string> clowns = { "pennywise", "bobo" };

evaluate_clown(clowns[0], evilness(2.5, factor));
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Indentation
Indentation should always be tab characters. It is up to you how wide you set tab characters in your editor for your personal tastes. All code blocks delimited within curly braces should be indented neatly and uniformly.

## Constants and \#define macros
Constants and macros should be all `UPPERCASE` with `SNAKE_CASE` to separate words. Macros should not have any unexpected side effects.

## Comments
All comments should be in `doxygen` format (similar to javadoc). Please see existing class definitions for an example. You should use doxygen style comments in a class definition inside a header file, and can use any other comment types within the .cpp file. Be liberal with comments, especially if your code makes any assumptions!

## Symbol exporting
If you export a class which is to be accessible to users, be sure to prefix it with the `DPP_EXPORT` macro, for example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
class DPP_EXPORT my_new_class {
public:
	int hats;
	int clowns;
};
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The `DPP_EXPORT` macro ensures that on certain platforms (notably Windows) the symbol is exported to be available to the library user.

## Public vs private vs protected
It is a design philosophy of D++ that everything possible in a class should be public, unless the user really does not need it (you should consider justifying in comments why) or user adjustment of the variable could badly break the functioning of the library. Avoid the use of accessors for setting/getting values in a class, except for bit fields, where you should provide accessors for setting and getting individual bits (for example, see `user.h`), or in the event you want to provide a "fluent" interface. The exception to this is where you want to provide a logic validation of a field, for example if you have a string field with a minimum and maximum length, you can provide a setter the user can *optionally use* which will validate their input.

## Exceptions
All exceptions thrown should derive from dpp::exception (see dpp/exception.h) - when validating string lengths, a string which is too long should be truncated using dpp::utility::utf8substr and any strings that are too short should throw a dpp::length_exception.

## Inheritance
Keep levels of inheritance low. If you need to inherit more than 3 levels deep, it is probable that the design could be simplified. Remember that at scale, there can be tens of millions of certain classes and each level of virtual nesting adds to the `vtable` of that object's instance in RAM.

## Bit field packing
Where discord provides boolean flags, if the user is expected to store many of the object in RAM, or in cache, you should pack all these booleans into bit fields (see `user.h` and `channel.h` for examples). In the event that the object is transient, such as an interaction or a message, packing the data into bit fields is counter intuitive. Remember that you should provide specific accessors for bit field values!

## Keep dependencies internal!
Where you are making use of an external dependency such as `opus` or `libssl`, do not place references to the types/structs, or the header files of these external libraries within the header files of D++. Doing so adds that library as a public dependency to the project (which is bad!). Instead make an opaque class, and/or forward-declare the structs (for examples see `sslclient.h` and `discordvoiceclient.h`).

## API type names
Where discord provide a name in PascalCase we should stick as closely to that name as possible but convert it to `snake_case`. For example, GuildMember would become `guild_member`.

## Don't introduce any platform-specific code
Do not introduce platform specific (e.g. windows only) code or libc functions. If you really must use these functions safely wrap them e.g. in `#ifdef _WIN32` and provide a cross-platform alternative so that it works for everyone.

## Select the right size type for numeric types
If a value will only hold values up to 255, use `uint8_t`. If a value cannot hold over 65536, use `uint16_t`. These types can help use a lot less ram at scale.

## Fluent design
Where possible, if you are adding methods to a class you should consider fluent design. Fluent design is the use of class methods tha return a reference to self (via `return *this`), so that you can chain object method calls together (in the way `dpp::message` and `dpp::embed` do). For example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
class DPP_EXPORT my_new_class {
public:
	int hats;
	int clowns;

	my_new_class& set_hats(int new_hats);
	my_new_class& set_clowns(int new_clowns);
};

my_new_class& my_new_class::set_hats(int new_hats) {
	hats = new_hats;
	return *this;
}

my_new_class& my_new_class::set_clowns(int new_clowns) {
	clowns = new_clowns;
	return *this;
}

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This would allow the user to do this:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~{.cpp}
dpp::my_new_class nc;
nc.set_hats(3).set_clowns(9001);
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

## Keep all D++ related types in the dpp namespace

All types for the library should be within the `dpp` namespace. There are a couple of additional namespaces, e.g. `dpp::utility` for static standalone helper functions and helper classes, and `dpp::events` for internal websocket event handlers.

## Commit messages and Git

All pull requests ("PRs") should be submitted against the `dev` branch in GitHub. Itâ€™s good to have descriptive commit messages, or PR titles so that other contributors can understand about your commit or the PR Created. Read [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0-beta.3/) for information on how we like to format commit messages.

All PRs must pass the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/actions) tests before being allowed to be merged. This is to ensure that no code committed into the project fails to compile on any of our officially supported platforms or architectures.
