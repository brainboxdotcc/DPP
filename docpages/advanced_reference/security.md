\page security Project Security Design

D++ is designed with the following security goals in mind:

* D++ design will be user friendly to help avoid shooting yourself in the foot and introducing security vulnerabilities in the code.
* D++ will keep external dependencies to an absolute minimum at all times so there is less chance of third party code making your bot vulnerable to attack.
* D++ design will take the path of 'least surprise', and will be simple and straightforward to use, leading to less developer errors that could lead to vulnerabilities
* Any reported CVEs which are logged via the proper channels will be fixed within 14 days
* All settings, configuration and parameters will be secure by default
* D++ settings and design will conform to Discord TOS and will not implement or support features that break the Discord TOS.
