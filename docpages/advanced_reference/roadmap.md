\page roadmap Development Roadmap

At present our roadmap is:

*Short term (6 months):*: Stabilise coroutine support and release it as stable a feature

*Long term*: Continue development of the library to implement Discord new features as they add them. Discord do not share their internal roadmap with library developers, so we are informed of these new features shortly before they become public given enough time to implement them. This is our permanent ongoing goal.
