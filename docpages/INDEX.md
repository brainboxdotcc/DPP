# D++: A C++ Discord API Library for Bots

## What is D++ (DPP)?

D++ is a lightweight and simple library for Discord written in modern C++. It is designed to cover as much of the API specification as possible and to have a incredibly small memory footprint, even when caching large amounts of data.

It is created by the developer of [TriviaBot](https://triviabot.co.uk) and contributed to by a dedicated team of developers.

*This project is in stable development and accepting PRs and feature requests — Don't be a stranger! If you want to contribute, just get in touch via [GitHub](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP) or our official [Discord server](https://discord.gg/dpp)!*

## Library features

* Support for Discord API v10
* Really small memory footprint
* Efficient caching system for guilds, channels, guild members, roles, users
* Sharding and clustering (Many shards, one process: specify the number of shards, or let the library decide)
* Highly optimised ETF (Erlang Term Format) support for very fast websocket throughput (*no other C++ Discord library has this!*)
* [Slash Commands/Interactions support](https://dpp.dev/slashcommands.html)
* [Voice support](https://dpp.dev/soundboard.html) (sending **and** receiving audio)
* The entire Discord API is available for use in the library
* Stable [Windows support](https://dpp.dev/buildwindows.html)
* Ready-made compiled packages for Windows, Raspberry Pi (ARM64/ARM7/ARMv6), Debian x86/x64 and RPM based distributions
* Highly scalable for large amounts of guilds and users

## Supported Operating Systems

The library runs great on **Linux**. **Windows** is also supported and we offer ready made compiled DLL and LIB files for easy integration into any windows visual studio 2019/2022 project.
**Mac OS X** and **FreeBSD** is also functional and stable, as is running your bot on a **Raspberry Pi** — we offer a prebuilt .deb for ARM64, ARMv6 and ARMv7 to save on having to wait for it to compile.

The library may work fine in other operating systems too, if you run a D++ bot on something not listed here please let us know!
