\page build-a-bot-xcode Building a Discord Bot using Xcode (OSX)

\warning This tutorial expects you to have installed D++ via homebrew. If you haven't, please visit \ref install-brew.

To create a bot with Xcode, follow the steps below to create a *working skeleton project you can build upon*.

1. Make sure you have Xcode downloaded, along with the developer command tools (for AppleClang).
2. Clone the [template project](https://github.com/Jaskowicz1/mac-bot-template/). **Make sure you download the entire project and not just the .cpp file.**
3. Open Xcode, hit "Open Existing Project" or "File"->"Open", navigate to the template folder and open the .xcodeproj file. You can also double click the file in Finder.
4. Replace "add your token here" with your bot's token in the "main" file.
