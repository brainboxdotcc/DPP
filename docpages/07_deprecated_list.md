\page deprecated Deprecated List

### Deprecation policy

We keep things marked as depreciated until next major API version.
If discord removes the function, we may remove the method from the library or replace it with a thrown exception depending on the type of function and at our discretion.
Such functions which are made to throw will then be removed at the next major API version.
