\page deprecated Deprecated List

## Deprecation policy

We keep things marked as deprecated until the next major API version. If Discord removes the function, we may remove the method from the library or replace it with a thrown exception depending on the type of function and at our discretion. Such functions which are made to throw will then be removed at the next major API version.
