/**
 * @brief Call a D++ REST function synchronously.
 * 
 * Synchronously calling a REST function means *IT WILL BLOCK* - This is a Bad Thingâ„¢ and strongly discouraged.
 * There are very few circumstances you actually need this. If you do need to use this, you'll know it.
 * 
 * Example:
 * 
 * ```cpp
 * dpp::message m = dpp::sync<dpp::message>(&bot, &dpp::cluster::message_create, dpp::message(channel_id, "moo."));
 * ```
 * 
 * @warning As previously mentioned, this template will block. It is ill-advised to call this outside of
 * a separate thread and this should never be directly used in any event such as dpp::cluster::on_interaction_create!
 * @tparam T type of expected return value, should match up with the method called
 * @tparam F Type of class method in dpp::cluster to call.
 * @tparam Ts Function parameters in method call
 * @param c A pointer to dpp::cluster object
 * @param func pointer to class method in dpp::cluster to call. This can call any
 * dpp::cluster member function who's last parameter is a dpp::command_completion_event_t callback type.
 * @param args Zero or more arguments for the method call
 * @return An instantiated object of type T
 * @throw dpp::rest_exception On failure of the method call, an exception is thrown
 */
