/**
 * @brief Collects objects from events during a specified time period.
 * 
 * This template must be specialised. There are premade specialisations which you can use
 * such as dpp::reaction_collector and dpp::message_collector. For these specialised instances
 * all you need to do is derive a simple class from them which implements collector::completed().
 * 
 * A collector will run for the specified number of seconds, attaching itself to the
 * given event. During this time any events pass through the collector and collector::filter().
 * This function can return a pointer to an object to allow a copy of that object to be stored
 * to a vector, or it can return nullptr to do nothing with that object. For example a collector
 * attached to on_message_create would receive an event with the type message_create_t, and from
 * this may decide to extract the message_create_t::msg structure, returning a pointer to it, or
 * instead may choose to return a nullptr.
 * 
 * When either the predetermined timeout is reached, or the collector::cancel() method is called,
 * or the collector is destroyed, the collector::completed() method is called, which will be
 * passed a list of collected objects in the order they were collected.
 * 
 * @tparam T parameter type of the event this collector will monitor
 * @tparam C object type this collector will store
