/** @class job job.h coro/job.h
 * @brief Extremely light coroutine object designed to send off a coroutine to execute on its own.
 * Can be used in conjunction with coroutine events via @ref dpp::event_router_t::operator()(F&&) "event routers", or on its own.
 *
 * This object stores no state and is the recommended way to use coroutines if you do not need to co_await the result.
 *
 * @warning - This feature is EXPERIMENTAL. The API may change at any time and there may be bugs.
 * Please report any to <a href="https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/DPP/issues">GitHub Issues</a> or to our <a href="https://discord.gg/dpp">Discord Server</a>.
 * @warning - It cannot be co_awaited, which means the second it co_awaits something, the program jumps back to the calling function, which continues executing.
 * At this point, if the function returns, every object declared in the function including its parameters are destroyed, which causes @ref lambdas-and-locals "dangling references".
 * For this reason, `co_await` will error if any parameters are passed by reference.
 * If you must pass a reference, pass it as a pointer or with std::ref, but you must fully understand the reason behind this warning, and what to avoid.
 * If you prefer a safer type, use `coroutine` for synchronous execution, or `task` for parallel tasks, and co_await them.
