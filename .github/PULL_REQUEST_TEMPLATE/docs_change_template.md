## Documentation change checklist

- [ ] My documentation changes follow the same style as the rest of the documentation and any examples follow the [coding style guide](https://dpp.dev/coding-standards.html).
- [ ] I tested that my change works before raising the PR (via running `doxygen`, and testing examples).
- [ ] I have not moved any existing pages or changed any existing URLs without strong justification as to why.
- [ ] I have not generated content using AI or a desktop utility such as grammarly.
