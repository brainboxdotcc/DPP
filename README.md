* [Slash Commands/Interactions suppport](https://dpp.brainbox.cc/slashcommands.html)
* [Voice support](https://dpp.brainbox.cc/soundboard.html)
* Pretty much the entire Discord API is available for use in the library
* [Windows support](https://dpp.brainbox.cc/buildwindows.html)

This library is in use on [TriviaBot](https://triviabot.co.uk/) and [Sporks bot](https://sporks.gg).

## Documentation

The documentation is a work in progress, generated from the code comments and markdown using Doxygen.

#### [View D++ library documentation](https://dpp.brainbox.cc/)

## Supported OSes

The library runs best on **Linux**. **Windows** is supported via cmake and Visual Studio 2019 but not encouraged for production use.
The library may work fine in other operating systems too, but with no access to these we cannot support them.
