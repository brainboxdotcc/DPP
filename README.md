D++ is a lightweight and efficient library for Discord written in modern C++, covering as much of the API specification as possible with an incredibly small memory footprint even when caching large amounts of data.

### Library features:

* Support for Discord API v10
* Really small memory footprint
* Efficient caching system for guilds, channels, guild members, roles, users
* Sharding and clustering (Many shards, one process: specify the number of shards, or let the library decide)
* Highly optimised ETF (Erlang Term Format) support for very fast websocket throughput
* [Slash Commands/Interactions support](https://dpp.dev/slashcommands.html)
* [Voice support](https://dpp.dev/soundboard.html) (sending **and** receiving audio)
* The entire Discord API is available for use in the library
* Stable [Windows support](https://dpp.dev/buildwindows.html)
* Ready-made compiled packages for Windows, Raspberry Pi (ARM64/ARM7/ARMv6), Debian x86/x64 and RPM based distributions
* Highly scalable for large amounts of guilds and users

This library is in use on [TriviaBot](https://triviabot.co.uk/) and [Sporks bot](https://sporks.gg) and many other bots!

## Documentation

The documentation is a work in progress, generated from the code comments and markdown using Doxygen.

#### [View D++ library documentation](https://dpp.dev/)

### Example

This is a simple ping-pong example using slash commands.

```c++
#include <dpp/dpp.h>
#include <cstdlib>
 
int main() {
    dpp::cluster bot(std::getenv("BOT_TOKEN"));
 
    bot.on_slashcommand([](auto event) {
         if (event.command.get_command_name() == "ping") {
             event.reply("Pong!");
         }
    });
 
    bot.on_ready([&bot](auto event) {
        if (dpp::run_once<struct register_bot_commands>()) {
            bot.global_command_create(
                dpp::slashcommand("ping", "Ping pong!", bot.me.id)
            );
        }
    });
 
    bot.start(dpp::st_wait);
}
```

You can find more examples in our [example page](https://dpp.dev/md_docpages_03_example_programs.html).

## Supported Systems

### Linux
The library runs ideally on **Linux**.

### Mac OS X and FreeBSD
The library is well-functional and stable on **Mac OS X** and **FreeBSD** too.
For running your bot on a **Raspberry Pi**, we offer a prebuilt .deb package for ARM64, ARM6, and ARM7 so that you do not have to wait for it to compile.

### Windows
**Windows** is well-supported with ready-made compiled DLL and LIB files, please check out our [Windows Bot Template repository](https://github.com/brainboxdotcc/windows-bot-template). The Windows Bot repository can be cloned and integrated immediately into any Visual Studio 2019 and 2022 project in a matter of minutes.

### Other OS
The library should work fine on other operating systems as well, and if you run a D++ bot on something not listed here, please let us know!

## ü§ù Contributing

Contributions, issues and feature requests are welcome. After cloning and setting up project locally, you can just submit 
a PR to this repo and it will be deployed once it's accepted.
